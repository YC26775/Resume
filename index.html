              Subsequently, established 3D existing culvert models using
              OpenRoads Designer (ORD) and then delivered existing culvert
              layouts. Performed hydraulic analysis for existing culvert using
              HY-8 and ORD. Finally, produced culvert hydraulic calculation

              Set up RAS models to analyze 1-D steady-state flow hydraulics for
              the proposed and existing conditions for the reaches behind the
              central market for different storm frequency using GeoHECRAS. And
              then designed the open channel cross section in RAS model for
              proposed condition by calculating the existing and proposed
              reaches capacity using FlowMaster to optimize the flow to lower
              the water level for 100-yr flood event.
